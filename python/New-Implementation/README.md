# Singly Linked List

A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer. Python does not have linked lists in its standard library. We implement the concept of linked lists using the concept of nodes.

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O for space = O(1)
Big O for time = O(n)

using classes to implement linked list data structure.

## API

- [x] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- [x] Can properly insert into the linked list
- [x] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- [x] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- [x] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- [x] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist
- [x] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
